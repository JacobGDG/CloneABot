Investigating whether death could be an enjoyable method of advancing through a video game.

My third year project was to investigate a game mechanic. We were given free reign on what we were allowed to investigate. I decided to find out if death needs to be a negative mechanic and could it be used as a method of advancing through the game.

It went through a iterative development process with each interation being playtested by a focus group to understand what aspects worked and did not work.

Unity is required inorder to build and run the game.
